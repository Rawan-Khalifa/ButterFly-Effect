# ButterFly-Effect

The project is based on modifying the railway system converting mechanical energy into electrical energy. The prototype resulted in 22.59 milliwatts per train carriage, and with calculations, the project generates 8 megawatts/day on a large scale. 

The project includes a monitoring system utilizing voltage/current sensors with NodeMCU. The results are displayed on a website with prototype simulation and further project analysis.
